In large organizations, there can be so many candidates who applying for the interviews. So, managing massive number of candidate details is a huge task. Also, those details are hard to access and maintain. So, this is a mini project developed using PHP & XML which manages the interviews of the company. By using this system anyone who has the access can login to the interview management system and view the details of candidates and easily find the candidates details and their interview marks. All the required details and CV, photograph should be uploaded to the system. File manipulation process is done using XML.

The project contains the only **_admin side._** The admin can view, add and delete all the candidates according to their choice. They can also add and update interview questions.

This system is for making the admin work, convenient for taking interviews by marking digitally instead of the manual system. An admin user can register & login to the system to carry out interviews and make decisions of the candidates. This project is a simple project that makes a convenient way for any interviewer to keep the records and judgments of the interview

The technologies I've used : 
- PHP
- XML
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- WAMMP Server
- MySQL
- Text Editior - Visual Studio Code

Before, you work on this , you have to install the new version of the XAMPP server and the MySQL server.

1. [WAMPP Server](https://fileswin.com/wampserver/download/)
2. [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)


And I've used some bootsrap codes in my project. You can apply bootsrap to the system through the following link :
